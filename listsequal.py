.Check if two lists are equal (have the same elements in the same order).

list1 = [10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 16, 15, 16, 12]
list2 = [16, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 10, 11, 12, 10, 12]
if list1 == list2:
    print('Lists are equal i.e. contain similar elements with same frequency')
else:
    print('Lists are not equal')
